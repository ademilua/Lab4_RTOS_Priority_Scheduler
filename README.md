# Lab4_RTOS_Priority_Scheduler
Grading your Lab 4 does require a LaunchPad development board. Your assignment is to implement a very simple RTOS that runs three event threads and five main threads. In particular, we are asking you to modify the main program, such that  Task0 runs exactly every 1ms (jitter less than 10us) Task1 runs exactly every 100ms (jitter less than 30us) Task2 runs every 100ms (average within 5%) Task3 runs at least 3 times (push button 1) Task4 runs approximately every 1s (average less than 1.2s) Task5 runs approximately every 1s (average within 5%) Task6 runs approximately every 1s (average less than 1.0s)
